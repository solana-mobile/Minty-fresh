## Minty Core

Roles & Responsibilities:

- Encapsulates business logic around the end-to-end NFT minting operation, including asset uploading to decentralized storage and all on-chain transactions.

NOTE: If minting logic is rolled into the Metaplex SDK, the logic in this module could be reduced in complexity or the module could potentially be removed entirely.
